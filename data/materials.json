    "itemDesc": "The Tremola Grenade GPb-1 is a HE Grenade that can only be launched from a Grenade Launcher. It cannot be thrown by hand. It has a 4s fuse. It deals decent damage against structures. Despite its description it deals Explosive damage and not High Explosive. It has a much longer range than thrown grenades allowing it to be used efficiently and safely without the help of Smoke Grenades or friendly suppressive fire (unlike the Mammon 91-b HE grenade).",
